# OpenRCT2-OpenMusic
This project aims to create an alternative to the music from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 for use in [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2).

## Progress
### Fairground Organ style
Although most/all of the [pieces from the fairground organ style](http://rct.wikia.com/wiki/Music) are so old that they fall under public domain, just creating an alternative arrangement is currently not a priority for this project. Instead some other songs/pieces of classical music are arranged to fit the style of the fairground organ.

#### Theoretical background
A fairground organ is a musical instrument that usually plays by itself. It usually contains a small/medium sized pipe organ with a few different stops, lots of percussion (xylophone, tambourine, triangle, cymbals, multiple kinds of drums) and sometimes a Glockenspiel and/or Bells.
The scores exists as [music rolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_roll) or [book music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_music).

#### Porting a piece of music to the fairground organ
First we need to find a suitable piece of music. Not all pieces are appropriate, can be converted, or are available under public domain. A march usually works pretty good. Then we need some free sheet music. [IMSLP is your friend](http://imslp.org/). Even if it's just for piano, that can be enough. Then we make an arrangement of that score in [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) using the provided Template (TODO). [TODO... Ardour... exporting... stuff]

#### Status
| Piece of music | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Funiculi Funicula | [Doodle of score](https://cuervo.phoenix.uberspace.de/music/fufa.pdf), [idea of finished piece (currently free for noncommercial use only)](https://cuervo.phoenix.uberspace.de/music/fufa3.ogg) |
| Entry Of The Gladiators | Idea |
| I've Been Working on the Railroad | Idea |
| In the Hall of the Mountain King | Idea |
| Der treue Husar | Idea |

Some piecees that might work:

* Schubert Impromptu Op. 90 No. 3
* Rachnaninov 2./3. PC / short interpretation?
* Muss i denn
* Vivaldi - Le quattro stagioni (Autumn, Winter?)

### Other music styles
Currently there are no plans for the other music styles.
