# OpenRCT2-OpenMusic
This project aims to create an alternative, higher quality version of the music from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 for use in [OpenRCT2](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2).

## Progress
### Fairground organ style
All of the pieces from the fairground organ style are so old that they fall under public domain.

#### Theoretical background
A fairground organ is a musical instrument that usually plays by itself. It usually contains a small/medium sized pipe organ with a few different stops, lots of percussion (xylophone, tambourine, triangle, cymbals, multiple kinds of drums) and sometimes a Glockenspiel and/or Bells.
The score exists as [music rolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_roll) or [book music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_music).

The fairground organ is limited by its instruments. As all pieces should be in the same style and sound as if they are played by the same fairground organ, all arrangements are limited to the same instruments and the same set of organ registrations (yet to be determined).

#### Status
The lists of the pieces of music in the game credits and [here](http://rct.wikia.com/wiki/Music) are unfortunately not 100% correct. If you know the name of the missing pieces, please let me know!

### Other music styles
A few of the other music styles are original compositions for the game, so the can't be recreated. The others could. TODO.
